Overview

This repository contains the work submitted for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project.
The goal of the project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a dataset to create a tidy dataset that can be used for further analysis.

How the Script Works

The script run_analysis.R performs the following steps:

1. Load libraries – Uses the dplyr package.


2. Read raw data – Reads features, activity labels, training and test datasets.


3. Merge datasets – Combines training and test data into one dataset.


4. Extract mean and standard deviation measurements.


5. Use descriptive activity names – Replaces activity codes with names.


6. Label variables clearly – Makes variable names descriptive and readable.


7. Create tidy dataset – Groups data by subject and activity, and calculates the average for each measurement.


8. Save output – Exports the tidy dataset into tidy_dataset.txt.

How to Run the Script

1. Download and unzip the data:
UCI HAR Dataset


2. Place the UCI HAR Dataset folder in your working directory.


3. Run the script in R:

source("run_analysis.R")


4. The tidy dataset tidy_dataset.txt will be created in the working directory.

Final Dataset

File name: tidy_dataset.txt

Dimensions: 180 rows × 68 columns

Description: Contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
