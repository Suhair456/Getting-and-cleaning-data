CodeBook

Overview

This CodeBook describes the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean and create the final tidy dataset for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The data used in this project comes from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset collected by the UCI Machine Learning Reposito.
Raw Data

Source: UCI HAR Dataset

Files included:

features.txt: List of all features measured.

activity_labels.txt: Links activity IDs to activity names.

train/ and test/ folders: Contain the training and test datasets.
Variables

subject: ID of the subject (integer: 1–30).

activity: Type of activity performed (character: WALKING, SITTING, etc.).

features:

Variables are sensor signals (accelerometer, gyroscope) measured as mean and standard deviation.

Units are normalized and bounded within [-1, 1].
Transformations

The following transformations were applied in the script run_analysis.R:

1. Merge training and test sets to create one dataset.


2. Extract measurements only on the mean and standard deviation.


3. Replace activity codes with descriptive activity names.


4. Rename variables with descriptive names (e.g., tBodyAcc-mean() → TimeBodyAccelerometerMean).


5. Create a second tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each subject and each activity.

Final Dataset

File name: tidy_dataset.txt

Content:

Each row = unique subject + activity combination.

Each column = average value of a variable.


Size: 180 rows × 68 columns.
